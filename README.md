# Moop City Front End  

React front end for the Moop City API, created as part of the Bright Network Technology Academy.

Moop City 2.0 is a website to view citizens, houses and workplaces from the virtual city database, and to add new people and buildings to the city.

## How to Install  
Create a local Psql database called "serverside". 
Clone the repository and adjust the application.properties file in the back end Java src folder, if your local Psql username and password differ from those in the file.  
Navigate into the /frontEnd/moop_city_front directory. Run ```$ npm install``` to install all dependencies. 

## How to Use
Run the Spring application by navigating to /backEnd/BNTA-Server-side-Project and running the ServersideApplication class in the Java src folder.  
While the Spring application is running, run ```$ npm start``` from within the /frontEnd/moop_city_front directory, to start the React project locally. 
This should open the web page automatically, or you can visit http://localhost:3000/ to view the site.  
From there, you can enjoy exploring Moop City, which will already have some inhabitants. You can also add new buildings and citizens.
